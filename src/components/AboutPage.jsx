              I did some self teaching for awhile then went to a coding boot
              camp to round out my knowledge. Now I have finished that boot camp
              where I learned all the tools to become a full stack developer. So I
              am currently looking to get my foot in the door to get a job in
              software development.

              Hey y'all, I'm an up and coming junior developer. You could say
              I'm generally a tech-savy person. Hardware, software, frontend,
              backend, chances are that I've fiddled around with it at some
              point. Planning to go on to work at my family's business, Sycamore
              Leaf Solutions. Excited to get my hands dirty with whatever life
              gives me next!

              My overlapping interest in art and STEM led me to make a full time
              commitment to learning full-stack development at Midlandâ€™s Code
              Academy. Due to the immersive nature of the program, I have gotten
              familiar with being uncomfortable and understand that is where
              growth is. I am eager to explore the immense possibilities that
              tech presents and growing as a developer along the way.

              people building the cool stuff. Let's build some cool stuff
