// shouldnt we just bind roomId to the function at the top? idk if that would work

// I think it would need to be separate ? but i am not 100% on that
//Okay, sounds good, I just figured having it separated would make it more reusable, but let me know what he says (:
// Ill ask russ
// My new moto is //! "Thank god for Russell"
// fr what would we do without him
// Crash and burn im sure... at least for me lol
// nah hes carrying this class rn
// Most definitely!!! If he doesn't get hired as a lead dev I am going to quit this field
// we riot if he isnt making $100k out the gate
// Yes, I will grab my pitchfork
// its 2022 and you still have a pitchfork
// Only for the big foods that I cant fit on my normal fork
// what a lame joke that was
// yes the biggest noodles
// big spaghett
// pool noodle sized ramen
// im patenting that
// dont steal it
//I am sure if it is written in code comments then it is legally binding, you're covered
// you know theres a chat menu
//in vs code???
// yea with liveshare
// oh man, good thing you warned me. I'm sure there is an interview question abou that
// I think it is funny that you're still using comments even though you just found that out
// ok i only just found out about it like a minute ago so chilllll
// okay i dont know how to bring it back up but i know it exists
// LOLLL
// the frick u just do 
//WHAT AM I DOING!!

//I would probably cry if this got deleted :,,(
// Because if so we should prob delete these comments lol
// nah let mike see it when we pull, he'd get a kick out of it. //! 21st century note passing
